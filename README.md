# twitter_scraper
better to use jupyter notebook to run code cell by cell
twitter_scraper use python and selenium for scraping 

the tweets You may got have 50% duplication this is bcoz page scrolling.. you can adjuest it by chnage the range in for loop but it better to leave as it as.. But you can use database manuplutions commands after your completion of program.

in my test case of program  total tweets scraped in 79 Miniuts is 1648 and total uniqu tweets are 1087 from 1648

Read python comments in program too understands code
